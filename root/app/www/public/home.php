            The list of 3<sup>rd</sup> party apps that utilize the starr app API's is ever growing but their is no limitation to what they can do and access! Most apps need very 
            little access to function so why expose every method available and full access to your database needlessly?<br><br>

            Permission scopes for apikeys is something that would be better served native in the apps but as it stands that request was denied years ago so it was time to simply make it 
            possible with another solution.
